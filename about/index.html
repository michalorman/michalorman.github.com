  His personal belief is that right tools should be chosen for right
  problems. He doesn't like to be forced to use one-and-only tool to
  <q>rule them all</q>. He likes simplicity and pragmatic approach to
  software development. He is perfectionist that will polish his
  design and code to achieve satisfactory level. He loves clean code,
  good design, tests, loose coupling and he is a zealot of SOLID
  principles and Agile approach to software development. He loves to
  automate every single repetitive task. He can spend hours discussing
  pros and cons of each framework or technology he use as well as
  debating about design.
</p>

<p>
  His weapons of choice are Ubuntu Linux as operating system, Intellij
  IDEA for Java/Android development, Emacs, RubyMine for
  Ruby/Rails/HTML/JavaScript development, Git and GitHub for version
  controlling. He likes lightweight,
  flexible environments that's why he prefer Spring Framework over
  J2EE stack. He also loves Sinatra, Backbone.js, CoffeeScript, SASS
  and lot more.
