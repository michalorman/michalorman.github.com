Currently everybody wants to be agile. Agile software development is mainstream
and if you're not agile you're probably considered to be less productive therefore
not as competetive. Everybody labels themself as agile, but not everybody understands,
that true agility is not available for all, and by all I mean developers,
organizations and clients.

Agility is not just doing software in short iterations. Real agility requires certain
mindset, certain behaviours and a way of thinking. Also in agile projects everybody
plays in the same team. Everybody swims in the same river. If on any level there is a
clear distinction on them and us the agility cannot be achieved. By any level we can
consider contract level (if client is willing to collaborate), organization level (if our internal
processes or procedures allows us to be agile), development level (if our staff has
appropriate experience and skills to be agile).

Why I'm talking about all of this? It is my general thought, conclusion after I've
attended to [Agile in Business conference](http://konferencje.computerworld.pl/konferencje/agile2/zagadnienia.html).
We had a track about how to construct agreement for an agile project. We had speaking
some lawyers and people considering themselves as experts that negotiate agile contracts.
And what really suprised and irritated me is that not everybody of those speakers knows
what does it mean to be agile. Some even repeat myths like agile project is just start
work without any plan and see where and how it goes. They do not know or understand
principles behind Agile Manifesto.

I understand that not every client is willing to collaborate. I understand that if we
work for corporation we could have tons of management on top of us, which may expect
something from us or do not care about all this agile stuff. But in order to be agile lots
of prerequisites must be met. It is a completely different mindset which drags
changes in the organization and a way the client is participating in a project. If
some of this prerequisites cannot be met do not do agile. You won't be able
to achieve appropriate level of agility and loose organization will turn against the
project and supplier.

What are the prerequisites? You can use following as checklist, but I'm sure that lot
of agilists could be able to add more:

* Client is willing to collaborate and understands that delivering products with
highest possible value is the responsibility of both sides not just the supplier's.
* Organization is ready the change its mindset and delegate the responsibility
for project realization to the team.
* Employers are competent enough to form cross-functional teams that will be able
to deliver valuable increments in short time.
* There are employers competent enough to initiate and motivate self-organization of a teams.

In corporations especially second point is extremely difficult to achieve as corporations
by design are organized around the command and control principle.

So if you cannot met any of the above prerequisities do not even try agile, or try
but on some internal, not important projects. Because bad agile could be worse than lack
of agile at all and if project fails you will drop the blame on all this agile stuff. Agile is
simply not for everyone.
