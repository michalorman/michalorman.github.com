Two last days I've spent on the conference about **Agile in
business**. Conference was very interesting despite that it wasn't
much about business. My general observation is that most discussions
about agile is missing the point. I've realized that after great talk
of **Arie van Bennekum**. He said:

> Agile is a way of delivering business value in a adaptive way.

Most of time people are fighting lightweight vs. traditional methods
of project management. Scrum or Kanban like those are the only way to do
projects in agile. The true is that those
people are totally wrong. If you're doing Scrum, you're doing
Scrum. If you are doing PRINCE2 it doesn't mean that you're not doing
it agile. **You're agile only if you are capable of delivering business
value, or achieving business goals in a adaptive way**. Scrum, PRINCE2
are just a tools that properly used can help you achieving this goal.

The true is that there are no agile or non-agile methodologies by
definition. It is the people that make those methodologies agile. In
fact I'm able to prove everybody that PRINCE2 is no less agile than
Scrum or Kanban (and I've heard the same about PMBOK or RUP). If people
define processes and procedures that prevent them from delivering business
values, and respond to changes, it is the problem of procedures not
the methodology itself.

I would say that there are no methodologies that prevent you from being
agile. You can be agile even in waterfall. Being agile doesn't mean
doing Scrum or Kanban. In fact not always you can use those
methodologies in some cases more formal approach is
required (or you apply some formalisms on top of Scrum or Kanban). Everything depends on certain context. If you can deliver
business value in a adaptive way you are agile no matter the
methodology or approach.
