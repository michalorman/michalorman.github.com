Finally the time has come to resume my blogging activity. Lot of time
has passed since I published post for the last time. Many have changed
since then.

First I've decided to drop what I've already published and start
again. It took me some time to make this decision, but at the end I'm
certain that it is a way I should go.

I've completely redesigned layout and blog structure. Layout follows
newest standards HTML5 and CSS3 and in my opinion is much better than
the old one. I've also decided to publish posts in English rather than
in Polish. IT society is nowdays one big village and English is the
language that everybody must know. At this place I would like to
apologize everybody that feels harmed with my not-so-big English
skills. I know that I'm not the best in English, but at the end
blogging in English is a very good way to master this skill.
