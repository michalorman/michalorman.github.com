Presentation I've lately done about integration of
[Spring 3.1](http://www.springsource.org/) and
[Backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/).

<div class="presentation" style="width:425px" id="__ss_12129376"><iframe

Presentation isn't that interesting, while it only outlines some new
features of Spring 3.1 and briefly describes what Backbone.js is. More
interesting is the demo application available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/consileonpl/spring-3.1-backbone.js-todo-list). Application
is quite simple however it presents Spring's XML-less configuration
(Servlet 3.0 without `web.xml`, JPA without `persistence.xml`), some
basic testing of Backbone with
[Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/) and more.
